# Forrest Run Tournament
Simple simulation of running tournament! Add participants and choose a theme. After starting program will simulate and display 
in console the course of the run.  


## Overview
This application simulates outdoor races on a track composed of various types of terrain. The participant's goal is to complete 
the track as quickly as possible and reach the finish line. The participant's efforts are commented on by a commentator. 
The participants themselves also express their opinions about the track elements and their struggles.

You don't have any control of how the race will roll, you can see description of whole race after it's finished.


## Expanding and modyfication
My job here was to expand existing basic code, which only contained one race with no participants. I've used inheritation, lambda
constructions and other Java features in order to improve and expand this application.


## Status
Repository is completely finished and will not be further modified.
